This file lists the work that is still needed to finish 
refactoring ATO to work with Tpetra/Thyra instead of 
Epetra/EpetraExt, in no particular order (dependencies 
b/w action items are noted).  

1. Test / debug (if necessary) Tpetra function ReplaceDiagonalValues,
currently in Albany::Utils (should ultimately be moved to the 
Tpetra::CrsMatrix class). This function is used in the 
ATOT::XFEM_Preconditioner.cpp class. Currently there is no example
for this preconditioner. 

2. Have Mark Hoemmen fix Tpetra::CrsMatrix::apply method with a 
TRANS combine mode.  Once this is done, remove creation of 
filterOperatorTpetra in ATO::Solver and ATOT::Solver, and
uncomment relevant apply code in copyObjectiveFromStateMgr 
routines.

3. Switch Albany to use workset.dgdpT (Tpetra version) instead 
of workset.dgdp (Epetra version) -- need debug help from Mauro.
The switch should be straight forward but when I try it, ATO::Constrained_2D_adj
test fails.  Once this is done, remove ALBANY_EPETRA_EXE ifdefs in 
ATO::TensorPNormResponse and ATO::HomogenizedConstantsResponse 
around workset.overlapped_dgdpT, as well as other relevant 
routines throughout Albany.  
to use these new objects.

4. Test/debug new ATOT::Solver by running tests with AlbanyT 
executable.  

Currently, the following tests seg fault when run:

- Constraint_2D_adj 
- Constraint_2D_fd
- DistParam_2D
- BodyForce_2D (uses NLopt) 
- CurrentOpt (uses NLopt)
- ResidualStrain (uses NLopt)
- VolumeObj_StiffnessCon (uses NLopt)
- VolumeObj_StressCon (uses NLopt) 

error in debug: 


p=0: *** Caught standard std::exception of type 'std::logic_error' :

5. Once 4. is done, activate tests that run with AlbanyT executable.

This file lists the work that is still needed to finish 
refactoring ATO to work with Tpetra/Thyra instead of 
Epetra/EpetraExt, in no particular order (dependencies 
b/w action items are noted).  

1. Debug Tpetra function ReplaceDiagonalValues,
currently in Albany::Utils (should ultimately be moved to the 
Tpetra::CrsMatrix class). This function is used in the 
ATOT::XFEM_Preconditioner.cpp class. 

2. Have Mark Hoemmen fix Tpetra::CrsMatrix::apply method with a 
TRANS combine mode.  Once this is done, remove creation of 
filterOperatorTpetra in ATO::Solver and ATOT::Solver, and
uncomment relevant apply code in copyObjectiveFromStateMgr 
routines.

3. Switch distributed parameters in Albany to use Tpetra instead 
of Epetra.  This requires replacing workset.overlapped_dgdp and 
workset.dgdp with Tpetra versions and changing calls in 
ATO::TensorPNormResponse and ATO::HomogenizedConstantsResponse 
to use these new objects.

4. Test/debug new ATOT::Solver by running tests with AlbanyT 
executable.  

Currently, the following tests seg fault when run:

- Constraint_2D_adj: ATOT_Solver.cpp:610,1615 (*) 
- Constraint_2D_fd: ATOT_Solver.cpp:610,1615 (*) 
- DistParam_2D: ATOT_Solver.cpp:610,1615 (*) 

(*) error in debug: 
p=0: *** Caught standard std::exception of type 'Teuchos::NullReferenceError' :
 /home/ikalash/LCM/Trilinos/packages/teuchos/core/src/Teuchos_RCPNode.cpp:741:
 Throw number = 1
 Throw test that evaluated to true: true
 Teuchos::RCP<Tpetra::Map<int, int, Kokkos::Compat::KokkosDeviceWrapperNode<Kokkos::Serial, Kokkos::HostSpace> > const> : You can not call operator->() or operator*() if getRawPtr()==0!


The following tests fail when run with AlbanyT: 

- 2Matl_Homog 
- RegHeaviside_3D 

Note that NLOpt was not on in my build; need to build
with NLOpt and test NLOpt tests as well.  These tests are:

- BodyForce_2D 
- CurrentOpt 
- ResidualStrain 
- VolumeObj_StiffnessCon
- VolumeObj_StressCon

Note also that Cogent was not on in my build; need to build with Cogent
and test Cogent tests.  These tests are: 
- Cogent_Opt
- Cogent_Tab

Also, all ATO fails when Epetra is turned off (seg faults).  Need to debug. 

5. Once 4. is done, create tests that run with AlbanyT executable.

  Abstract =	 {{In this paper the error associated with the
                  remapping problem is analyzed. A range of numerical
                  results that assess the performance of three
                  different remapping strategies, applied to FE meshes
                  that typically are used in sheet metal forming
                  simulation, are evaluated.  One of the selected
                  strategies is the previously presented Incremental
                  Volumetric Remapping method (IVR), which was
                  implemented in the in-house code DD3TRIM. The IVR
                  method fundaments consists on the premise that state
                  variables in all points associated to a Gauss volume
                  of a given element are equal to the state variable
                  quantities placed in the correspondent Gauss
                  point. Hence, given a typical remapping procedure
                  between a donor and a target mesh, the variables to
                  be associated to a target Gauss volume (and point)
                  are determined by a weighted average. The weight
                  function is the Gauss volume percentage of each
                  donor element that is located inside the target
                  Gauss volume. The calculus of the intersecting
                  volumes between the donor and target Gauss volumes
                  is attained incrementally, for each target Gauss
                  volume, by means of a discrete approach. The other
                  two remapping strategies selected are based in the
                  interpolation/extrapolation of variables by using
                  the finite element shape functions or moving least
                  square interpolants. The performance of the three
                  different remapping strategies is address with two
                  tests. The first remapping test was taken from a
                  literature work. The test consists in remapping
                  successively a rotating symmetrical mesh, throughout
                  N increments, in an angular span of 90 degrees. The
                  second remapping error evaluation test consists of
                  remapping an irregular element shape target mesh
                  from a given regular element shape donor mesh and
                  proceed with the inverse operation. In this second
                  test the computation effort is also measured.  The
                  results showed that the error level associated to
                  IVR can be very low and with a stable evolution
                  along the number of remapping procedures when
                  compared with the other two methods. Besides, the
                  method proved to be very robust even in critical
                  remapping situations such as poor geometrical
                  definition of the mesh domain boundaries.}},

                  different mapping techniques usually applied in the
                  field of hierarchical adaptive FE-codes. The
                  calculation of mechanical field variables for the
                  modified mesh is an important but sensitive aspect
                  of adaptation approaches of the spatial
                  discretization. Regarding non-linear boundary value
                  problems procedures of mesh refinement and
                  coarsening imply the determination of strains,
                  stresses and internal variables at the nodes and the
                  Gauss points of new elements based on the transfer
                  of the required data from the former mesh. The kind
                  of mapping of the field variables affects the
                  convergence behaviour as well as the costs of an
                  adaptive FEM-calculation in a non-negligible
                  manner. In order to improve the stability as well as
                  the efficiency of the adaptive process a comparison
                  of different mapping algorithms is presented and
                  evaluated. Within this context, the mapping methods
                  taken into account are an element-oriented
                  extrapolation procedure using special shape
                  functions, a patch-oriented transfer approach and,
                  the allocation of nodal history-dependent state

                  developed to solve the problems of the load transfer
                  and interface surface tracking are presented. The
                  main criterion is to achieve conservation of total

                  is based on Gaussian integration and fast
                  interpolation algorithms for unstructured grids.
                  The surface tracking algorithm, also based on

                  including aeroelastic deformation of wings due to

  Abstract =	 {{An algorithm for computing matrix functions is
                  presented. It employs a Schur decomposition with
                  reordering and blocking followed by the block form
                  of a recurrence of Parlett, with functions of the
                  nontrivial diagonal blocks evaluated via a Taylor
                  series. A parameter is used to balance the
                  conflicting requirements of producing small diagonal
                  blocks and keeping the separations of the blocks
                  large. The algorithm is in tended primarily for
                  functions having a Taylor series with an infinite
                  radius of convergence, but it can be adapted for
                  certain other functions, such as the
                  logarithm. Novel features introduced here include a
                  convergence test that avoids premature termination
                  of the Taylor series evaluation and an algorithm for
                  reordering and blocking the Schur form. Numerical
                  experiments show that the algorithm is competitive
                  with existing special-purpose algorithms for the
                  matrix exponential, logarithm, and
                  cosine. Nevertheless, the algorithm can be
                  numerically unstable with the default choice of its
                  blocking parameter (or in certain cases for all
                  choices), and we explain why determining the optimal
                  parameter appears to be a very difficult problem. A
                  MATLAB implementation is available that is much more
                  reliable than the function funm in MATLAB 6.5

  Abstract =	 {{Mesh adaptivity on unstructured meshes is a proven
                  and popular tool for reducing the computational cost
                  of numerical simulations. Unstructured meshes are
                  often preferred in mesh adaptivity as they allow for
                  greater geometric flexibility and arbitrary
                  anisotropy in resolving simulation
                  features. However, such mesh adaptivity suffers from
                  a significant drawback: the interpolation errors
                  caused by interpolating from the old mesh to the new
                  mesh typically destroys conservation of quantities
                  important to the physical accuracy of the simulation
                  (e.g., density, volume fraction, tracer
                  concentration, etc.). This work presents several
                  globally conservative interpolation operators
                  between general unstructured meshes via the
                  construction of an intermediate supermesh.  The
                  construction of the supermesh is performed by
                  transforming the problem to the input to a
                  constrained meshing problem. The performance of the
                  conservative interpolation operators are compared
                  against interpolation using the underlying basis
                  functions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

  Abstract =	 {{Due to the demands on mathematical models that
                  simulate physical properties and behaviors of
                  automotive components, different finite element
                  meshes often partition the same component for each
                  disparate simulation. Commercial packages that
                  transfer mesh dependent results from one finite
                  element analysis to initialize another typically use
                  a variation of a specific nodal based mapping. The
                  simplicity and ease of implementation make this
                  mapping very attractive. In its simplest form, the
                  mapping first assigns a node in the analyzed model
                  the average value of the elements that share the
                  node. A node in the unanalyzed mesh receives its
                  value from the closest node in the analyzed mesh.
                  Nodal based interpolants on the new element
                  initialize elemental values. When an element in the
                  unanalyzed mesh requires a constant value such as
                  its thickness, the element receives the average
                  value at the nodes that define the element. This
                  brief paper documents some undesirable
                  characteristics of this nodal based transfer of
                  material properties from one mesh to another.}},

                  concepts and tools needed for solving problems of a
                  geometric nature using a computer. It attempts to
                  fill the gap between standard geometry books, which
                  are primarily theoretical, and applied books on
                  computer graphics, computer vision, robotics, or
                  machine learning. This book covers the following
                  topics: affine geometry, projective geometry,
                  Euclidean geometry, convex sets, {SVD} and principal
                  component analysis, manifolds and Lie groups,
                  quadratic optimization, basics of differential
                  geometry, and a glimpse of computational geometry
                  {(Voronoi} diagrams and Delaunay
                  triangulations). Some practical applications of the
                  concepts presented in this book include computer
                  vision, more specifically contour grouping, motion
                  interpolation, and robot kinematics. In this
                  extensively updated second edition, more material on
                  convex sets, Farkas "s lemma, quadratic optimization
                  and the Schur complement have been added. The
                  chapter on {SVD} has been greatly expanded and now
                  includes a presentation of {PCA.} The book is well
                  illustrated and has chapter summaries and a large
                  number of exercises throughout. It will be of
                  interest to a wide audience including computer
                  scientists, mathematicians, and engineers. Reviews
                  of first {edition:"Gallier's} book will be a useful
                  source for anyone interested in applications of
                  geometrical methods to solve problems that arise in
                  various branches of engineering. It may help to
                  develop the sophisticated concepts from the more

  Abstract =	 {{The scaling and squaring method is the most widely
                  used method for computing the matrix exponential,
                  not least because it is the method implemented in
                  MATLAB's expm function. The method scales the matrix
                  by a power of 2 to reduce the norm to order 1,
                  computes a Pade approximant to the matrix
                  exponential, and then repeatedly squares to undo the
                  effect of the scaling. We give a new backward error
                  analysis of the method ( in exact arithmetic) that
                  employs sharp bounds for the truncation errors and
                  leads to an implementation of essentially optimal
                  efficiency. We also give new rounding error analysis
                  that shows the computed Pade approximant of the
                  scaled matrix to be highly accurate.  For IEEE
                  double precision arithmetic the best choice of
                  degree of Pade approximant turns out to be 13,
                  rather than the 6 or 8 used by previous authors. Our
                  implementation of the scaling and squaring method
                  always requires at least two fewer matrix
                  multiplications than expm when the matrix norm
                  exceeds 1, which can amount to a 37\% saving in the
                  number of multiplications, and it is typically more
                  accurate, owing to the fewer required squarings. We
                  also investigate a different scaling and squaring
                  algorithm proposed by Najfeld and Havel that employs
                  a Pade approximation to the function x coth(
                  x). This method is found to be essentially a
                  variation of the standard one with weaker supporting
                  error analysis.}},

  Abstract =	 {{In multiphysics simulations using a partitioned
                  approach, each physics component solves on its own
                  mesh, and the interfaces between these meshes are in
                  general non-matching. Simulation data (e.g. jump
                  conditions) must be exchanged across the interface
                  meshes between physics components. It is highly
                  desirable for such data transfers to be both
                  numerically accurate and physically
                  conservative. This paper presents accurate,
                  conservative, and efficient data transfer algorithms
                  utilizing a common refinement of two non-matching
                  surface meshes. Our methods minimize errors in a
                  certain norm while achieving strict
                  conservation. Some traditional methods for data
                  transfer and related problems are also reviewed and
                  compared with our methods. Numerical results
                  demonstrate significant advantages of
                  common-refinement based methods, especially for
                  repeated transfers. While the comparisons are
                  performed with matching geometries, this paper also

                  for the assessment of adaptive strategies for the
                  solution of associative rate-independent plasticity
                  problems solved by employing the incremental
                  displacement conforming finite element method. This
                  is the first step towards a more rational definition
                  of transfer operators in terms of the ensuing
                  error. The motivating idea is the observation that
                  change of data and/or finite element mesh from one
                  time interval to the other can be both related to a
                  discontinuity jump of the approximate solution
                  across the time instant t(n). Thus, reliable a
                  posteriori estimates will have to depend not only on
                  the time step and finite element mesh size but also
                  on the value of the jump. A new error estimate based
                  on the error in the constitutive equations is
                  developed which allows characterization of the
                  discontinuity jump. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley

                  framework for mesh adaption in strongly nonlinear,
                  possibly dynamic, problems. We begin by showing that
                  the solutions of the incremental boundary value
                  problem for a wide class of materials, including
                  nonlinear elastic materials, compressible Newtonian
                  fluids and viscoplastic solids, obey a minimum
                  principle, provided that the constitutive updates
                  are formulated appropriately. This minimum principle
                  can be taken as a basis for asymptotic error
                  estimation. Tn particular, we chose to monitor the
                  error of a lower-order projection of the finite
                  element solution. The optimal mesh size distribution
                  then follows from a posteriori error indicators
                  which are purely local, i.e. can be computed
                  element-by-element. We demonstrate the robustness
                  and versatility of the computational framework with
                  the aid of convergence studies and selected examples
                  of application. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All

  Abstract =	 {{A computational procedure for remapping material
                  state information from one finite element mesh to
                  another is described. The procedure is useful in
                  connection with evolving meshes for inelastic
                  problems, as for example occur in the context of
                  fracture simulation and adaptive mesh
                  refinement. The proposed method is based on weak
                  enforcement of equality between corresponding fields
                  on the two meshes, where piecewise-constant fields
                  on both meshes are generalized from the
                  quadrature-point values. The essential algorithmic
                  problem is that of calculating the volume partition
                  of an arbitrary convex region with respect to a
                  covering set of disjoint convex regions. Instead of
                  geometrically resolving the associated
                  intersections, the problem is herein approximated by
                  a constrained optimization problem, which may be
                  readily and efficiently solved computationally. This
                  formulation is a main contribution of the
                  paper. Computational examples are given that
                  illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
                  procedure. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons,

This readme contains the steps to build netcdf-c-4.7.4 as installed in

/projects/albany/gcc-9.1.0

Source is at

/projects/albany/src/netcdf-c-4.7.4

1. Edit include/netcdf.h, near line 273, to be:

#define NC_MAX_DIMS     65536 /* not enforced after 4.5.0 */
#define NC_MAX_ATTRS    8192 /* not enforced after 4.5.0 */
#define NC_MAX_VARS     524288 /* not enforced after 4.5.0 */
#define NC_MAX_NAME     256
#define NC_MAX_VAR_DIMS 8 /**< max per variable dimensions */

2. cd into the above and type:

./configure CC=/projects/albany/gcc-9.1.0/bin/mpicc FC=/projects/albany/gcc-9.1.0/bin/mpifort CXX=/projects/albany/gcc-9.1.0/bin/mpicxx CPPFLAGS="-fPIC -I/projects/albany/gcc-9.1.0/include -O3 -march=native" CFLAGS="-fPIC -I/projects/albany/gcc-9.1.0/include -O3 -march=native" FCFLAGS="-fPIC -I/projects/albany/gcc-9.1.0/include -O3 -march=native" LDFLAGS="-fPIC -I/projects/albany/gcc-9.1.0/lib -O3 -march=native" --prefix=/projects/albany/gcc-9.1.0 --disable-doxygen --enable-netcdf4 --enable-pnetcdf --enable-remote-fortran-bootstrap

make -j 8

make -j 8 install

( cd netcdf-fortran ; make clean )

make -j 8 build-netcdf-fortran

make -j 8 install-netcdf-fortran

Note: the above edit will cause both "make check" and "make -j 8 build-netcdf-fortran" to fail. 
I do not run "make check" and I ignore the build-netcdf-fortran error and proceed to the fortran install step. Everything
appears to be fine when I do this.

The netcdf people say the above edit is not needed and has no effect. Why is it there then? Greg Sjaardema said to me that
these changes are needed, and I have experienced errors and failures on large exodus files if you do not do them. So I do them.

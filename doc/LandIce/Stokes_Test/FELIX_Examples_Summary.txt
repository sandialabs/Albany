   description: First order Stokes flow model of a spreading of 
                dome of ice with a circular base and parabolic top.  There is no sliding.
   dofs: u, v, w, p viscosity = Glen
   Domain: The domain from this problem is generated as follows.  
           First take a cylinder of radius 1 centered at (x,y) = (0,0) in the x-y 
           plane having height 1 in the z-direction.  Then the following 
           transformation is applied: 
              x = 0.7071*30*x; 
              y = 0.7071*30*y; 
              z = s*z where s = 0.7071*sqrt(450-x^2-y^2)/sqrt(450)
           The result is a dome-shaped mesh having radius approximately 21 km and
           height approximately 0.7071 km. The top surface is given by the
           expression s above; the basal surface is given by z = 0.   
   Mesh: The cylinder of radius 1, height 1 
         is meshed using CUBIT, so an exodus mesh is required for this problem
         (dome_cyl.exo).  The journal file that generates this exodus mesh is
         dome_cyl.jou. 
   BCs: No-sliding (same as no-slip) at the basal boundary.
        Stree-free at the top boundary.
        Lateral BCs: u=v=w=0.
   Other parameters: 
     A and n (Glen's law params): same as ISMIP-HOM test cases
     rho = 910 kg/m^3 (ice density)
     g = 9.8 m/s^2 (gravitational constant)

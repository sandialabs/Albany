   description: First order Stokes flow model of a spreading of 
                dome of ice with a circular base and parabolic top.  There is no sliding.
   dofs: u, v, viscosity = Glen
   Domain: The domain from this problem is generated as follows.  
           First take a cylinder of radius 1 centered at (x,y) = (0,0) in the x-y 
           plane having height 1 in the z-direction.  Then the following 
           transformation is applied: 
              x = 0.7071*30*x; 
              y = 0.7071*30*y; 
              z = s*z where s = 0.7071*sqrt(450-x^2-y^2)/sqrt(450)
           The result is a dome-shaped mesh having radius approximately 21 km and
           height approximately 0.7071 km. The top surface is given by the
           expression s above; the basal surface is given by z = 0.   
   Mesh: The cylinder of radius 1, height 1 
         is meshed using CUBIT, so an exodus mesh is required for this problem
         (dome_cyl.exo).  The journal file that generates this exodus mesh is
         dome_cyl.jou. 
   BCs: No-sliding (same as no-slip) at the basal boundary.
        Stree-free at the top boundary.
        Lateral BCs: u=v=0.
   Other parameters:

    Remarks: The ice shelf in this example is pinned in the middle of the base
    of the cylinder.  Currently, the nodes to be pinned are specified manually 
    in the shelf_cyl.jou file.  If one wishes to use a finer/coarser mesh, 
    currently it is necessary to manually fine what node #s to pin (label node
    on command) and modify the .jou file accordingly.

    It was on this test that it was discovered that equal order velocity/pressure 
    finite elements with PSPG stabilization fail to converge with mesh 
    refinement when the viscosity is given by Glen's law.  The constant-coefficient
    viscosity variant of this problem can be generated by setting n = 1 in

The following are broken in the temporary branch following the merge of master -> tpetra: 

4.) Have Mauro test mpas_interface.  There are some bugs still in ExtrudedSTKMesh struct causing unstructured FO_GIS examples to fail. Probably the same issue will be encountered through the mpas_interface.  --> Irina & Mauro 

10.) ATO suite needs to be converted to Tpetra. Irina has put in for now a an error in CMakeLists.txt if ATO is requested
as it will not build in the Tpetra branch (even with Albany executable).  The code needs to be converted to use the Tpetra 
objects.  To do this, 8.) and 9.) need to be resolved, as ATO makes heavy use of BlockMap.

11.) It appears code (temporary_tpetra_newSTK branch) doesn't build with ENABLE_SG_MP turned ON.  This should work with Epetra.  Need to figure out what is wrong 
and fix.

12.) Get Albany_FMDBExodus.cpp working. Right now it fails to write an exo file. Comments in that file indicate the issue. All tests produce vtk, rather than exo, files, so this issue is not covered by tests.

13.) See if ASCR compiles (note that this requires SG_MP to be turned on) in temporary_tpetra_newSTK branch.  
Check if tests pass.  Not necessary to fix these yet, need to just let Eric Phipps know the status (10/23/14).

14.) Have Erik Nielsen/Rick Muller (QCAD guys) check ALBANY_CI with temporary_tpetra_newSTK branch of Albany.  Also 
have them run some "real" QCAD tests to check that everything still works (right now with Albany executable only).  Irina 
will do this.


Failed tests (10/13/14): 
The following tests FAILED:
	 51 - SteadyHeat2DInternalNeumann (Failed) - STK bug (Jim Foucar fixing; fails in branch master too)
	 52 - SteadyHeat2DInternalNeumann_Tpetra (Failed) - STK bug (Jim Foucar fixing)
	 73 - GPAM_Tpetra (Failed) - Failed comparison 
	295 - Aeras_XZScalarAdvection_Tpetra (Failed) - failed test (need to rebaseline b/c it wasn't baselined correctly?  - Irina)
              Aeras_TC2_Serial - See Error 5 below

Errors while running CTest

Error 5
  Some of the Aeras tests seem to fail depending on workset size. Andrew
B. thinks it might have to do with how
    Aeras_ShallowWaterResponseL2Error_Def.hpp
calculates the L^2 error. There may be two += that should actually be =. Right
now, it seems only Aeras_TC2_Serial is failing among the Aeras sets that use
that response function.

The scripts in this directory will checkout and build VOTD
versions of Trilinos, Dakota, and Albany, and run Albany's
tests. To get this running on your machine takes three steps:

1) Copy "set_glens_env.in" to a new name (e.g. "my_env.in")
and modify the required environment variables (mostly paths).  

2) To build and test

    ./run_master.sh  my_env.in


==============================================================

More details on files:

set_glens_env.in (also set_andys_env.in):
-----------------
File that sets required paths and environment variables,
set to those used successfully by Glen. All customizations
for individual users are in this one place. This filename
must be given as a command-line argument to run_master.sh. 
This command will build serial versions and run serial
tests.

    ./run_master.sh set_glens_env.in

will build parallel versions and run parallel tests

run_master.sh
--------------
Single script that (1) sources the file given as an
argument (see previous)), and (2) calls the following 
scripts in the order listed. 

  trilinos_checkout.sh
  ----------------
  checkout Trilinos votd from  git  repository

  dakota_checkout.sh
  ----------------
  Fetches the Dakota_votd tarball with the "wget" command,
  and untars all of Dakota within Trilinos/packages/TriKota

  trilinos_build_all.sh
  ----------------
  "cmake; make; make install;" all of Trilinos to include 
  everything needed by Albany, including TriKota which knows 
  how to build Dakota.
  Uses the cmake configure script:
     do_cmake_trilinos

  albany_build.sh
  ----------------
  git clone Albany from git repository, configure the
  code using above installed Trilinos and using the
  and build "Albany" "AlbanyDakota" "AlbanyAnalysis" and,
  "AlbanySG" executables.
  
  albany_runtest.sh
  -----------------
  Runs all the tests in Albany. These include standard
  tests (forward simulation with albany executable),
  Dakota tests (albanyDakota executable) for example problem
  directories with a "dakota.in" file, and Stochastic Galerkin
  problems (albanySG executable) for examples with an 
  inputSG.xml input file.

  send_email.sh
  -------------
  Script to email results of test to this  mail list:
    demoapps-regression@software.sandia.gov

::end of run_master.sh script

=========================================================
Note:
The standard output of the builds and test are sent
to separate files in the nightly test directory: 
under sub-driectories Albany_out, Trilinos_out,
and Dakota_out. (These paths are specified in the
file with environmental variables.)

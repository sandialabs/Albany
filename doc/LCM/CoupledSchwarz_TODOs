-----------------------Cleanup TODOs---------------------------

4.) Change variable/function names to comply with C++ coding standards [Alejandro].

5.) Further down the line, we'll want to clean up the input files to remove stuff that's not read in 
(e.g., the coupled one won't have a discretization section probably) [TBD -- I suggest we hold 
off on this for now until we decide definitively what'll be read in from what file.].

6.) Eventually we'll want to put an ifdef to suppress all the debug output [TBD].

7.) Reimplement get_p_names and get_p_space in SchwarzMultiscale class -- forming/storing coupled
vectors/arrays for these is not necessary. [TBD]   

---------------------Development TODOs------------------------

1.) We may want to put in validatian of parameter lists in LCM::SchwarzMultiscale class, 
if necessary.  It appears to be handled in general already in other parts of the code. [TBD?]

4.) Implement create_W_op() in SchwarzMultiscale.cpp.  Look at create_W function 
in QCAD_CoupledPoissonSchrodinger.cpp as an example.  We may want to write a separate class 
to return the Jacobian operator, as in QCAD. [TBD -- I suggest we hold off on this until we do 
the other easier stuff.  I also suggest in the first attempt we just implement the 
Jacobian for 2 models that are concatenated but not coupled.]

9.) Implement create_DgDx_op_impl and create_DgDx_dot_op_impl in SchwarzMultiscale.cpp. 
See QCAD_CoupledSchrodingerPoisson.cpp for an example. [TBD]

10.) Implement createOutArgsImpl() in SchwarzMultiscale.cpp. [TBD]

11.) Implement evalModelImpl in SchwarzMultiscale.cpp. [TBD]


------------------Questions/Comments/Notes-----------------------------

1.) create_W_prec() is not implemented in Thyra.  This means we will not have a preconditioner 
at the beginning.

2.) get_W_factory() is not needed -- just returns null.

4.) initial_guess, passed to the LCM::CoupledSchwarz constructor, is used to 
create the Albany_Application object for each model.  There, it's used to set 
the initial condition (AAdapt:InitialContitionsT).  It's used to set x_init 
and x_dot_init, part of nominal_values (get_x_init and get_x_dot_init for
the EpetraExt Model Evaluator). 

----------------Development Planning TODOs----------------------------------------


2.) Understand how the output will be done.  In QCAD::CoupledPoissonSchrodinger, a discretization 
object is created just for producing the collected output.  Need to understand how this works and 
how to extend it to our case.  A related question is whether we need to create an observer.  
We would need a routine that breaks up the final concatenated solutions into separate
ones and gives these to the mesh output routines (like separateCombinedVector in QCAD?).

3.) Figure out how we'll hook in Teko for the preconditioner.

-----------------Notes from emails with Andy---------------------------------------

1.) The CouplePS_NOXObserver takes a single vector for the fully coupled problem and
breaks it into separate vectors for output. The single vector has sizes like 4N+3 for
for potential and 3 eigenvectos, and it sends the 5 separate N vectors to exodus
using the eigenvalues as time stamps. 

2.) For all Thyra problems, and almost all EpetraExt problems, there is no Wprec. 
Then the preconditioner is built within Stratimikos based on the parameter list 
entries for Ifpack{2} or ML/MueLu. All of these internal preconditioners require
that W is a RowMatrix (parent abstract class of CRS matrix). If W is just an operator,
we can't do any internal preconditioning and problems must be run without a
preconditioner or with Wprec implemented.

3.) The Teko interface in Albany was done very
quickly when Teko was new. My understanding is that it has evolved since then, 
and the Albany implementation is not something we should look to or build on.
It is now accessible through Stratimikos and we should figure out how to call
it that way. 

4.) Thyra should have clean ways to construct a single vector from views of others, and
a matrix from views of sub-matrices. This will make everything much cleaner if
we can figure out the syntax.  Talk to Roger Pawlowski, Roscoe Bartless, Eric Cyr.

    Albany is the main demonstration application of the AgileComponets
    strategy. It is a PDE code that strives to be built almost entirely
    from functionality in reusable libraries (such as Trilinos/STK/Dakota).
    Albany plays a large role in demonstrating and maturing functionality
    of new libraries, and also in the interfaces and interoperability
    between these libraries. It also serves to expose gaps in our
    coverage of capabilities and interface.
    
    <br>
    
    Another aspect of the project is to serve as a template for
    writing new applications against Trilinos/STK/Dakota. It
    uses CMake, CTest, and git, and grabs almost all configuration
    information from installed Trilinos. Albany was granted
    OpenSource license to share with collaborators.
    
    <h3> Distinguishing Capabilities </h3>
  
    The highlight of Albany is the PDE assembly. The template-based
    generic programming approach allows developers to just program
    for residual equations, and all manner of derivatives and polynomial
    propogations get automatically computed with no development effort.
    This approach uses Phalanx for rapid and flexible addition of 
    physics, which works closely
    with Sacado and Stokhos for automatic propagation of
    derivatives and UQ. Intrepid and Shards packages are used for
    the local discretization. 
    
    <br>
    
    A second strength of Albany is the demonstration of
    transformational analysis algorithms.  Albany demonstrates
    the clean use of all Solver/Analysis tools in Trilinosi
    (through Piro, which was developed in Albany) including NOX, 
    LOCA, Rythmos, Stokhos,
    and all of Dakota. On any problem we not only get a solution,
    but can also get sensitivities, run optimization problems, and 
    perform uncertainty quantification.  All of these approaches
    can access all of the linear solver options in Trilinos that
    are exposed by the Stratimikos layer.
    
    <br>

    The third main strength
    is the early adoption of STK, the sierra toolkit libraries. 
    This includes the mesh database, IO, and willl be growing soon 
    to include mesh changes for stk_rebalance and stk_adapt.
    
    <h3> Physics Sets: what PDEs </h3>
  
    Albany strives for a bit of a paradigm shift, where a code
    is defined more by its analysis capabilities and data structure
    choices, which are difficult to change, and less by the physcics set. 
    
    <br>
    
    Much of Albany was developed in FY08-10 for solving simple heat transfer 
    and poisson equations. With nonlinear source terms, this was
    adequate for developing and verifying all the hooks for
    analysis algorithms from sensitivity analysis to UQ.
    Recenty, Navier-Stokes equations have been added to 
    the general Albany physics set.
    
    <br>
    
    In FY11, two new projects were funded to
    develop application codes on Albany. These physics
    sets are developed in the Albany code, yet are
    distinct in many ways as well: C++ namespace,
    project teams, and funding sources.
    
    <h3> LCM: Labratory for Computational Mechanics </h3>
    
    The first application project build on Albany is the LCM,
    or Laboratory for Computational Mechanics 
    [Ostien-PI, Salinger, Mota, Foulk, Littlewood].
    This project is creating an OpenSource computational mechanics 
    RandD code, with a particular emphasis on fracture and failure models. 
    The infrastructure in Albany, which is aimed at rapid development
    of new physics with automated generation of analytic derivatives 
    and sensitivities, is well suited for trying out new discretizations 
    and new material models.  The links to Dakota and handling of model 
    parameter are set up to perform calibration and UQ studies.
    LCM serves as a research tool that can be shared with
    academics. Successful research ideas and code will be
    migrated to the production mechanics applications of Adagio and Presto.
    Albany can link against the LAME material library, and we
    are looking at ways of getting derivative info through it
    for more robust solution algorithms.

    <h3> QCAD: Quantum Device Design </h3>
    
    The other new application code built on Albany is the
    QCAD quantum dot design LDRD (Schrodinger-Poisson) 
    [Muller-PI, Gao, Nielsen, Salinger]. A poisson solve for
    classical representation of charge distribution is
    coupled to a Schrodinger region for quantum effects.
    
    <h3> Embedded UQ </h3>
    
    Albany is also serving as a main development and
    demonstration environment for embedded UQ research
    [Phipps-PI, Wildey]. By leveraging the templated
    fill environment, polynomial representations can
    be directly propogated through the physics assembly.
    Many issues with data structures, parallelization, 
    and linear algebra are being addressed.
    
    <h3> Further development </h3>
    
    The new applications have exposed many weaknesses in the Albany
    code, and more importantly, some gaps in the aggregate 
    Agile Components infrastructure. For instance, an initial 
    implementation in Trilinos of time integrators has been
    developed in responses to the needs of the transient dynamics
    problem.
    
    <br>
    
    Future development includes: load balancing and uniform mesh refinement,
    transitioning to Tpetra and a templated software stack, being a testbed
    for embedded UQ methods, early adoption of architecture-aware PDE
    assembly kernels, and eventually a full error estimation and 
    adaptivity capability.
    
    <br>
    
    Albany is making the transition from a demonstration prototype
    to a research code. It still seriously lacks full boundary condition
    support, any multi-physics capability, post-processing, and 
    documentation (all the hard stuff). The sister code Drekar [Pawlowski, Cyr] 
    has developed the infrastructure for multi-physics applications 
    with varying physics and discretizations, which Albany does not support.

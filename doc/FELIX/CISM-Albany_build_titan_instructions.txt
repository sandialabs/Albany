This file describes how to build CISM-Albany on Titan, and how to run a few transient problems. 
I will assume you start this process in the directory: ~/ (your home
directory). 

1.) Get Trilinos, Albany and the felix_interface branch from their
repositories: 

module load git
module load subversion
git clone software.sandia.gov:/space/git/Trilinos
git clone software.sandia.gov:/space/git/Albany
svn checkout http://oceans11.lanl.gov/svn/PISCEES/branches/felix_interface

***NOTE: If you previously had a software.sandia.gov account but your password
does not work, you need to have it re-issued due to a migration of software to
a new server in March 2014.  You can email me (ikalash@sandia.gov) for more
information. 

2.) Build Trilinos as follows.

(a) Configure Trilinos:

    cd ~/Trilinos
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cp ~/Albany/doc/titan-trilinos-cmake .
    cp ~/Albany/doc/titan_modules_trilinos.sh .
    source titan_modules_trilinos.sh 
    source titan-trilinos-cmake 

(b) Make Trilinos: 

    make -j 8 

(c) Install Trilinos: 
    make install -j 8 

3.) Build Albany as follows.  

(a) Configure Albany. 

    cd ~/Albany
    mkdir cism-build
    cd cism-build
    cp ~/Albany/doc/titan-albany-cism-cmake
    cp ~/Albany/doc/titan_modules.sh .
    (source titan_modules.sh ***only do this if you did not just do this in the same window when you built Trilinos!)
    module unload cmake
    module load cmake (***you need to change the version of cmake for Albany from the one used in Trilinos.)
    Edit titan-albany-cism-cmake.  Change at the top of this file TRILINOS_INSTALL_DIR and CISM_INCLUDE_DIR to the paths of your Trilinos install and your CISM 
    libdycore directory.  In this case: 
      TRILINOS_INSTALL_DIR=~/Trilinos/build/install
      CISM_INCLUDE_DIR=~/felix_interface/libdycore
    source titan-albany-cism-cmake 

(b) Make Albany: 
    make -j 8 
 
(c) Install Albany: 
    make install -j 8 

(d) Check that the ~/Albany/build/install directory exists.  If it does not it
means your cmake probably was not high enough.  It should be high enough if
you use the cmake in titan_modules.sh .

4.) Build CISM-Albany as follows.

(a) cd ~/felix_interface/builds/titan-gnu-felix
    (source titan_modules.sh ***only do this if you did not just do this in the same window when you built Trilinos/Albany!)
    Edit titan-gnu-cmake.  Change at the top of this file TRILINOS_INSTALL_DIR and ALBANY_INSTALL_DIR to point to your Trilinos and Albany installs respectively.  In this case: 
      TRILINOS_INSTALL_DIR=~/Trilinos/build/install
      ALBANY_INSTALL_DIR=~/Albany/cism-build/install
    source titan-gnu-cmake

(b) Make CISM: 
    make -j 8 

5.) Now you are ready to run!  CISM-Albany is run through the simple_glide
executable.  I have input files ready to run Dome and 4km
GIS in a transient regime.  You can get them as follows: 

   cd ~/
   cp /ccs/proj/cli062/cism-albany/cism/problems.tar.gz .
   tar -zxvf problems.tar.gz 
   Before running, please create the following directory: /lustre/atlas/scratch/$USER/cli062/problems

   To run Dome: 
   cd problems/Dome
   Open job.pbs and edit the aprun line to point to your simple_glide executable: 
   ~/felix_interfaces/builds/titan-gnu-felix/example-drivers/simple_glide/src/simple_glide 
   in the example here.  Change also the "cp -r /ccs/proj/cli062/cism-albany/cism/problems/Dome" line to "~/problems/Dome" in this case (where you have the Dome problem input data)
   qsub job.pbs 
   You can play with different numbers of cores.  Also you can play with tend in dome.albany.config (make it longer to do a longer-time simulation for example).

   To run Gis4km: 
   Same as Dome but for job.pbs in problems/Gis4km. 

   The results will appear in the directory: /lustre/atlas/scratch/$USER/cli062/problems

# you'll see the max difference (in absolut value) between fields. Note that the raher significant difference in beta comes from the fact that beta is changed in cism according to the floating condition.

#Note: When the thickness and the bedrock topography are interpolated back to the grid, some accuracy is lost (try comparing the original "greenland.nc" with the newly created "geenland_standalone-albanyT.nc"). In fact, if you now re-run cism-alabny #using the new nc grid you'll see a significant difference with the standalone albany solution:

#move back to top folder
cd ..

#after modifying the inputFiles/cism-albanyT.config to use the new gid greenland_standalone-albanyT.nc, run cism-albanyT, and compare again

#quite a difference.. this is an interpolation error.. so it should diminish as the grid is refined.

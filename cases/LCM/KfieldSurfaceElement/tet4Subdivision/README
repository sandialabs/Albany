This test seeks to accomplish a few things

1) Run the subdivision code 

Subdivision --input="../meshes/KfieldTetForBarySymm.g" --output="KfieldTetBarySymm.g"

2) Run Albany with inputTet.xml to examine the stress field around the crack tip

You will notice that the fields don't look so great. 

Remember 

Cauchy_Stress_01 is S_11
Cauchy_Stress_02 is S_12
Cauchy_Stress_03 is S_13
Cauchy_Stress_04 is S_21
Cauchy_Stress_05 is S_22
Cauchy_Stress_06 is S_23
Cauchy_Stress_07 is S_31
Cauchy_Stress_08 is S_32
Cauchy_Stress_09 is S_33

The nodal values for the stresses are recovered quantities. Neighborhoods are created for each node and the value is found through both the value and the weight. Values are weighted averages.
